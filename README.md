# db-react-recap-use-effect-api

A recap looking at how we can use:

- `async / await` and `fetch()` to send requests and receive responses from external API'S.
- use the `useEffect()` hook to allow us to run code when a component is loaded and when a value changes.

The external resource is the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/);
